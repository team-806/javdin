# Project D: Dynamic Language

## 1. Common Description

- Dynamic typing: object types are not specified and can change while program
    execution.
- The language assumes interpretation.
- Major notion: variable & literal (constant).
- Program structure: a sequence of declarations and statements.
- Builtin types:
    integer, real, boolean, string
    User-defined types: array, tuple, function.
- Implicit type conversions are supported.
- Statements: assignment, if/while/loop, exit/return, output.

## 2. Informal language specification

The program is a sequence of statements. Statements can be separated by the
semicolon character or by newline characters.

```
Program : { Statement [ ; ] }
```
Statements execute one after the other, starting with the first in text statement.

There are two category of constructs: variable declaration and statement.

Declaration of the variable introduces a new named object to the current scope,
perhaps with an initial value. Statements define a specific action, whose semantics
could consist of calculation of new value for some variable (assignment), or changing
the sequential order of statements or of outputting values to the console.

Declaration of a variable could be in any position within in the program. A variable
introduced by a declaration is considered as active within its scope: from the point of
its declaration to the end of that scope. Within the scope, only one variable with the
given name is allowed.

If a certain scope contains other (nested) scopes, then variables declared in a
nested scope may have names that match the names in the enclosing scope. In this
case, variables from the nested scope hide variables with the same names from the
enclosing scope.

```
Declaration
: var VariableDefinition { , VariableDefinition }
VariableDefinition
: IDENT [ := Expression ]
```
When declaring a variable, you can set its initial value. The initial value of a variable
can subsequently be changed using the assignment operator. If the initial value of
the variable is not set, then it is considered that the variable has the special value
none. Value empty cannot act as an operand of operations; the only action on a
variable with this value is type checking using the is operation, see below.


The type of the variable is not fixed during declaration. This means that a variable,
within its scope, can take any type of values that are allowed in the language (see
“Types”). To check the type of the current value of a variable, there is a special unary
operation is.

The language defines a common set of common statements: except of the
declarations, which is also have a status of statements, there are assignment,
conditional statement, two kinds of repeat statements and also function return
statement and the print statement.

```
Statement
: Declaration
| Assignment
| If
| IfShort
| Loop
| Exit
| Return
| Print
Assignment
: Reference := Expression
If
: if Expression then Body [ else Body ] end
IfShort
: if Expression => Body
Body
: Statement { [ ; ] Statement }
Loop
: WhileLoop
| ForLoop
WhileLoop
: while Expression LoopBody
ForLoop
: [ ForHeader ] LoopBody
ForHeader
: for [ IDENT in ] Expression [ .. Expression ]
LoopBody
: loop Body end
Exit
: exit
```
Notice that the ForHeader part in the for-loop can be omitted. In that case, the loop
is infinite. The only way for exiting such a loop is exit statement.

The case with two Expressions in the loop header means that the loop iterates
over the range from v 1 until v2, where v 1 and v2 are current integer values of the

corresponding expressions. If the identifier is specified in the loop header then it
introduced a variable that takes values from the range sequentially on each loop
iteration. The scope of the variable is the loop body.


If the single Expression is specified in the loop header then its type should be
either an array or a tuple. In that case, the loop iterates over all elements of the
corresponding aggregate.

The exit statement can appear only within loop statements.

Examples:

```
var i := 0
loop // Infinite loop
print "Hello"
i := i + 1
if i=100 => exit
end
for 1.. 3 loop
print "Hello"
end
var array := [1,2,3,4,5]
var sum := 0
for i in array loop
sum := sum+i
end
```
Return statement performs leaving a function perhaps with returning a result value to
the calling context.

```
Return
: return [ Expression ]
Print
: print Expression { , Expression }
```
Expressions

Expression is a syntax constructs defining an algorithm for calculating new values.
The structure of expressions is traditional and includes several types of operands
and a set of infix and prefix operations on operands.

```
Expression
: Relation { ( or | and | xor ) Relation }
Relation
: Factor [ ( < | <= | > | >= | = | /= ) Factor ]
Factor
: Term { [ + | - ] Term }
Term
: Unary { ( * | / ) Unary }
Unary
: Reference
| Reference is TypeIndicator
| [ + | - | not ] Primary
Primary
: Literal
| FunctionLiteral
| ( Expression )
TypeIndicator
: int
| real
```

```
| bool
| string
| none // no type
| [ ] // vector type
| { } // tuple type
| func // functional type
```
Functions in the D language are treated as literals (similarly to integer/real constants)
in the sense that they are considered as constant values that can be assigned to
variables and passed as arguments to other functions. The only operation defined for
functions is a call.

```
FunctionLiteral
: func [ ( IDENT { , IDENT } ) ] FunBody
FunBody
: is Body end
| => Expression
Literal
: IntegerLiteral
| RealLiteral
| BooleanLiteral
```
The Reference production defines accessors – constructs that specify elementary
actions with variables: taking an array element, calling a function, and accessing
elements of objects. References can be operands of expressions, and also (this
distinguishes them from other operands - constants, subexpressions, etc.) act as
recipients of values in assignment operators.

```
Reference
: IDENT
| Reference [ Expression ] // array element
| Reference ( Expression { , Expression } ) // call
| Reference. IDENT // tuple element
| Reference. IntegerLiteral // tuple element
```
Types and literals

The language defines the values of four simple types, two composite types, and one
special type.

Simple types: integer, real, string, and boolean.

Integer literals are written as a sequence of decimal digits. Real literals are formed
as two sequences of decimal digits separated by the dot character. The first
sequence denotes the integer part of the real, the second sequence - its fractional
part. Strings are specified as a sequence of arbitrary characters enclosed in single or
double quotes. Boolean values are represented by two keywords true and false.

```
Literal
: INTEGER
| REAL
| STRING
| Boolean
| Tuple // { a := 5, b := "sss", 12.34 }
| Array // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
| none
```

```
Boolean
: true
| false
```
In addition to simple types, the language includes two composite types: arrays and
tuples.

Array is a linear composition of values of any type. The size of the array (number of
elements) is not fixed and can be dynamically changed. The array is presented as a
list of element values, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.

```
Array
: [ [ Expression { , Expression } ] ]
```
Access to the elements of the array is performed in the usual way: after the name of
the array in square brackets, the number of the element in the form of an integer
expression is specified. The numbering of the elements of the array begins with
one.

Note that an array is a “real” associative array with keys representing integer values.
The values of the neighboring keys in the array do not necessarily differ by one. So,
for example, the following sequence of operators is possible:

```
var t := []; // empty array declaration
t[10] := 25;
t[100] := func(x)=>x+1;
t[1000] := {a:=1,b:=2.7};
```
Tuple is a fixed-size collection of possibly named values of arbitrary types. Element
names, if they are specified, are unique within the tuple. A tuple is specified as a
comma-separated list of pairs of the form name := value. The name and value

are separated by the assignment token :=. The entire list is enclosed in braces.

```
Tuple
: { TupleElement { , TupleElement } }
TupleElement
: [ Identifier := ] Expression
```
The structure of tuples, unlike arrays, cannot be modified; the only way to change
the composition of the tuple elements is to add another tuple to it, for example:

```
var t := {a:=1, b:=2, c+d};
t := t + {e:=3}; // now t is {a:=1, b:=2, c+d, e:=3}
```
Access to the tuple elements is performed via dot notation, using the name of the
tuple variable and the name of the tuple element, or by using the number of the tuple
element within the tuple (numbering starts with one), for example:

```
var x := t.b; // now x is 2
x := t.2; // the same effect
var y2 := t.3 // now y2 has the value of c+d
```
Named and unnamed elements in a tuple can follow in any order.

Operator semantics

The semantics of expressions are generally typical of programming languages and
depend on the type of operands (operand). Since the language is dynamic, the
control of the types of operands and the selection of the appropriate operation
algorithm is performed dynamically during program execution.


Below is a table with a brief description of the operations.

Addition: +
Integer + Integer -> Integer
Integer + Real -> Real
Real + Integer -> Real
Real + Real -> Real
String + String -> String (string concatenation)
Tuple + Tuple - > Tuple (tuple concatenation)
Array + Array - > Array (array concatenation)

Other types of operands are not allowed.

Subtraction: -

Integer - Integer -> Integer
Integer - Real -> Real
Real - Integer -> Real
Real - Real -> Real

Other types of operands are not allowed.

Multiplication: *

Integer * Integer -> Integer
Integer * Real -> Real
Real * Integer -> Real
Real * Real -> Real

Other types of operands are not allowed.

Division: /

Integer / Integer -> Integer (round down)
Integer / Real -> Real
Real / Integer -> Real
Real / Real -> Real

Other types of operands are not allowed.

Comparisons: <, >, <=, >=, =, /=

Integer op Integer -> boolean

Integer op Real -> boolean

Real op Integer -> boolean

Real op Real -> boolean

Other types of operands are not allowed.

Unary plus and minus: +, -

op Integer -> Integer

op Real -> Real

Other types of operands are not allowed.

Logical operations: and, or, xor

Both operands must be Boolean. The result of operations is always boolean. Other
types of operands are not allowed.

Unary negation: not

The operand must be Boolean. The result of the operator is boolean. Other types of
the operand are not allowed.
